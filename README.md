this is a routine for reflecting on one's life as it progresses.

what were your goals last month? what important events happened last week? did you learn new skills? do you have new interests? does life have a purpose?

these daily, weekly and monthly markdown templates help you reflect on your past, live in the present, plan your future.

this reflection routine and its questions are under continuous improvement; please leave any suggestions by creating an issue!

maybe i need help translating these questions into other languages...
